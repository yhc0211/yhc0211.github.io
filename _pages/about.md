Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Science at [the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://gsbs.uth.edu/). My PhD advisor are [Dr.Ryan Sun](https://ryanrsun.github.io) and [Dr.Arjun Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharya-lab.com). I received my BS in Agronomy (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Track) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2020 and my MS in Biostatistics from UCLA in 2024 with [Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/). 

I am particularly interested in statistical genetics, especially the development and application of Bayesian mediation methods for high-dimensional data.

Outside of academics, I enjoy movies and TV shows, watching basketball and baseball (Go Dodgers!), and spending time with my dog, Lulu.
