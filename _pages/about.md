Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Science at [the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://gsbs.uth.edu/). I received my BS in Agronomy (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Track) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2020 and my MS in Biostatistics from UCLA in 2024 with [Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/) and [Arjun Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharya-lab.com). 

My research interests lie in statistical and population genetics, especially the use of computational and statistical methods to uncover biological mechanisms influencing cancer risk.

Outside of academics, I enjoy movies and TV shows, watching basketball and baseball (Go Dodgers!), and spending time with my dog, Lulu.
