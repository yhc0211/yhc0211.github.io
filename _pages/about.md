Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Science at [the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://gsbs.uth.edu/). I received my BS in Agronomy (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Track) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2020 and my MS in Biostatistics from UCLA in 2024 with [Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/) and [Arjun Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharya-lab.com). 

My research interests are statistcial genetics and population genetics. I am interested in using computational and statistical methods to explore biological mechanisms contributing to cancer risk.
